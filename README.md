## Setup

### Prerequisites

* Mac OS X
* Xcode command line tools
* LuaJIT (`brew install luajit`)

`make`

### Running

`./a.out`

## How to use the program

### Cycling through the modes

Click the button in the top left corner of the screen.

### Camera Mode

This is on by default. Square should be green.

So, the camera basically behaves like an Doom. Use `wasd` to move, use the arrow keys to look around.

Press `r` to move up, and `f` to move down.

### Point manipulation mode

This is off by default. Square should be gray.

All of the points should be highlighted white, and one of them should be highlighted green.

Use `wasd` and `rf` to move the point around in 3D space. Use the arrow keys to change the highlighted point.
